# Building Generative AI Applications with Amazon Bedrock Using Boto3

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this guide, ensure you have the following:

- An AWS account with access to Amazon Bedrock models (`amazon.titan-text-micro-v1:0`) in the `us-east-1` region.
- An IAM user with the necessary permissions to access and invoke the model.
- [AWS CLI](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi) installed and configured with your IAM userâ€™s access key and secret key.
- Python 3.8 installed along with an IDE of your choice.
- The latest version of the Boto3 library.

## Setting Up the Environment

### Install Boto3
Install Boto3 using `pip` to interact with AWS services in Python:

```bash
pip install boto3
```

## Writing the Python Script

Create a Python file (e.g., `blog_1.py`) and add the following code to interact with Amazon Bedrock.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import boto3
import json

# Set up the Amazon Bedrock client
bedrock_client = boto3.client(
    service_name="bedrock-runtime",
    region_name="us-east-1"
)

# Define the model ID
model_id = "amazon.nova-micro-v1:0"

# Prepare the input prompt
prompt = "Hello, how are you?"

# Create the request payload
body = { 
    "inferenceConfig": {
      "max_new_tokens": 2048
    },
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
          {
            "text": prompt
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
}

# print(json.dumps(body))

# Invoke the Amazon Bedrock model
response = bedrock_client.invoke_model(
    modelId=model_id,
    body=json.dumps(body)
)

# Process the response
result = json.loads(response["body"].read())
# print(result)
generated_text = "".join([output["text"] for output in result["output"]["message"]["content"]])
print(f"Response: {generated_text}")
```

## Running the Script
Execute the Python script with the following command:

```bash
python blog_1.py
```

## Expected Output
```bash
"Hello! I'm here and ready to assist you with any questions or information you need. How can I help you today?"
```

This script demonstrates how to use Amazon Bedrock with Boto3 to generate AI-powered responses using the `amazon.titan-text-micro-v1` model.

## Comparison Report

Here are the prompts rewritten in a clear and structured manner:  

1. **Greetings:**  
   - "Hello, how are you?"  

2. **Historical Question:**  
   - "Who was the 16th President of the United States? What were his major achievements?"  

3. **Summarization Task:**  
   - "Summarize the following passage:  
     *The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain in the late 18th century and spread to other parts of the world. It brought about significant changes in agriculture, manufacturing, mining, and transportation, which had a profound impact on the social, economic, and cultural conditions of the times.*"  

4. **Sentiment Analysis:**  
   - "Analyze the sentiment of the following text:  
     *'I absolutely love this new phone! It's so fast, and the camera quality is amazing. The battery life could be better, though.'*"  

5. **Creative Writing Prompt:**  
   - "Write a short story about a dragon who learns to live peacefully with humans."  

### **Comparison of AI Model Performance**  

| **Prompt** | **Amazon Nova-Lite** | **Mistral-7B** | **Claude 3 Sonnet** | **Best Output** | **Best Time** |
|------------|----------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Q.1 Greetings** | Echoed prompt | Irrelevant response | Neutral, AI disclaimer | Claude (relevant) | Claude (1.22s) |
| **Q.2 History** | Echoed prompt | Detailed, structured, factual | Concise, well-structured | Mistral (most details) | Nova (0.67s) |
| **Q.3 Summary** | Echoed prompt | Detailed, repetitive | Concise, well-structured | Claude (concise & coherent) | Nova (3.31s) |
| **Q.4 Sentiment Analysis** | Echoed prompt | Positive with minor critique | More structured, clear explanation | Claude (structured, stepwise) | Nova (0.72s) |
| **Q.5 Short Story** | Echoed prompt | Long, engaging, fantasy-rich | Shorter, but meaningful | Mistral (most engaging) | Nova (1.65s) |

### **Final Verdict:**  
**Claude 3 Sonnet** is the most **optimal** overall, balancing **conciseness, clarity, and accuracy.** However, **Mistral-7B** is superior for creative or in-depth queries, while **Amazon Nova-Lite** is too simplistic for practical use.
